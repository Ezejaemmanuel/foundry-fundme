Here is a detailed README for a Next.js project using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Framer Motion and Lottie:

# Next.js TypeScript Starter

This is a starter template for building a Next.js application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Framer Motion and Lottie.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for building server-rendered React applications. Provides file-system based routing, pre-rendering, support for TypeScript and more.

- **TypeScript** - Superset of JavaScript that provides optional static typing, classes, interfaces and more. Helps prevent bugs and provides auto-completion in IDEs.

- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling components. Easy to customize and integrate with Next.js.

- **Chakra UI** - Simple, modular component library for React that makes building accessible UI fast and themeable.

- **Framer Motion** - Powerful animation library for React. Makes animations extremely easy in React.

- **Lottie** - Library for rendering animations and vector graphics in real-time. Integrates beautifully with Framer Motion. 

## Folder Structure

- `pages` - Contains Next.js pages and routes.

- `styles` - Contains global styles, themes and CSS/SCSS files. Configured to work with Tailwind CSS.

- `components` - Reusable React components for the application.

- `hooks` - Custom React hooks.

- `utils` - Utility functions.

- `public` - Static assets including images, fonts etc. 

- `animations` - Lottie animations and Framer motion variants.

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. The `styles/globals.css` file configures Tailwind to remove unused styles in production builds.

Utility classes from Tailwind can be used directly in JSX code:

```jsx
export default function Button() {
  return (
    <button 
      className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded-lg"
    >
      Click Me
    </button>
  )
}
```

Tailwind configuration can be customized in `tailwind.config.js`. 

## Animations 

For animations, this project uses [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/).

Lottie animations can be imported into React components like this:

```jsx
import animationData from '/animations/animation.json';

export default function Animation() {
  return <Lottie animationData={animationData} />
}
```

Framer Motion variants for page transitions and other animations are defined in `animations/variants.ts`. These can be imported and used in components.

## Chakra UI

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) provides accessible and reusable components that can be used directly:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'

export default function ChakraButton() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>
}
```

Chakra UI theme can be customized in `styles/theme.ts`.

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to any hosting platform that supports Node.js like Vercel, Netlify etc.
